          <p>Colloquially known as mayo, this is the most simple
            and popular sauce in the world!</p>
            We will teach you how to make it in the comfort of your own home!
        </div>
            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 <i>egg yolks</i></li>
            <li>250g <i>seed oil</i></li>
            <li>1 <i>lemon</i></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of <i>mustard</i></li>
            <li><i>salt</i> as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate your egg yolks from your egg whites.</li>
            <li>Then, into your food processor, add your egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Start blitzing the egg yolks while slowly drizzling the oil.</li>
            <p>It is <strong>important</strong> that you do this slowly, or you
                 might split the sauce entirely.</p>
            <li>Once you've added about half of your oil, it's time to add 
                the juice from your lemon and a teaspoon of mustard.
                <p>Add your new ingredients <em>slowly</em>, just as we did
                    with the oil.</p></li>
            <li>Once we've reached the right consistency, it's time to season 
                with salt and voil√†! </li>
            <p>Be mindful to consume your mayo on the spot. 
                You can store it in the fridge, but you should consume it within
                the next 2 days.</p>
